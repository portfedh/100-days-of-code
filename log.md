##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: July 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  I refactored a function for the irr calculations in the grafana portfolio and updated the files that calls it. 

**Thoughts** Im breaking down the function so it can support an unlimited amount of arguments, since it was originally hardcoded for two bank accounts. In the same process, im breaking every function into smaller more atomic functions and realizing that if I organize the inputs a little better, I can re-use many of them.

### Day 2: July 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Im brekaing up another function for the irr calculations into smaller functions to be able to unit test. Work in progress.  

**Thoughts** Smaller functions provide more reusablity and testability. Doing this is good practice, and a little tedious. I wish I could do this faster.
