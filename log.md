# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: July 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  I refactored a function for the irr calculations in the grafana portfolio and updated the files that calls it. 

**Thoughts** Im breaking down the function so it can support an unlimited amount of arguments, since it was originally hardcoded for two bank accounts. In the same process, im breaking every function into smaller more atomic functions and realizing that if I organize the inputs a little better, I can re-use many of them.

### Day 2: July 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Im brekaing up another function for the irr calculations into smaller functions to be able to unit test. Work in progress.  

**Thoughts** Smaller functions provide more reusablity and testability. Doing this is good practice, and a little tedious. I wish I could do this faster.

### Day 3: July 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Finished simplifying irr functions. Also updated run files to run from MacOs and Linux. Made a change to pull latest docker image before running. 

**Thoughts** Creating run files for linux and Mac allows for testing the code in different platforms. Since i've been developing in both, I realized that the docker image needs to be pulled down to get the latest version before running.

### Day 4: July 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Created the first version of the Readme.md

**Thoughts** I kept putting this back because its a bit tedious, but it really helped me define more clearly the goals for the project and how each thing I code aligns with the bigger picture.

### Day 6: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Created the first version of the prices file for the IBKR account. 

**Thoughts** Not a lot of coding progress because I had to create the input file. I will do more coding tomorrow. Jupyter notebook is great for testing code before creating a whole script.
